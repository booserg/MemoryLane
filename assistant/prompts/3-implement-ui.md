### **Role**
You are an expert Obsidian plugin developer with deep knowledge of Vue.js, TypeScript, Obsidian API, and modern build setups.

---

### **Goal**
Create a Dual N-Back UI.
---

### **Context**
On the previous steps, the boilerplate of a new Obsidian plugin with an empty vue.js component was created.  
Now the component needs to be filled with UI.

- **Feature Requirements:**
  1. The visual part of the component needs to have a grid.
  1.1. 3x3 grid which stretches all the available width.
  1.2. The grid should form a square.
  1.3. The grid should scales as screen scales. Min available supported screen size is 100px. 
  1.4. If the screen is smaller than that then the square without grid should be shown and the fact needs to be reported to the dev console.
  2. Beneath the grid two buttons needs to be placed.
  2.1. Buttons needs to be aligned on the same horizontal line.
  2.2. Buttons needs to have margin between each other and also between border of the component.
  2.3. The left button caption "Position".
  2.4. The right button caption "Sound".
  2.5. Click on any of this buttons should log the event in the console.
  3. The component should supports two themes.
  3.1. Only on load the component needs to read the current os system theme (later theme).
  3.2. If the current theme is light then background of the grid should be white and grid cells should be separated with black borders.
  3.3. If the current theme is dark then background of the grid should be black and grid cells should be separated with white borders.
  3.4. If the current theme is unavailable, then it should be interpreted as the light system theme.
  3.5. The coloring should be easy to change and should be implemented with tailwind.
  3.5.1. Latest available version of tailwind needs to be installed.
  3.5.2. Tailwind configuration and setup steps should be find out by an executor.
  4. The component should be able to receive a pair of numbers which are the coordinates of the cell (0-2 indexed for 3x3 grid).
  4.1. The set cell should be marked with a circle filled with the color opposite to the color of the cell background.
  4.2. All the unset cells needs to be cleared and have no circle.
  4.3. The method that receives the pair should receive only one pair and invalidate any other arguments options.
  4.3.1. If invalid coordinate data arrives as argument then visually no changes should be, only the error should be reported into the dev console.
  4.4. Name of the method and the way how it's exposed are not that important but it should be available in dev console for testing purposes. 
  4.5. Cells in any state are static and have no behavior.
  4.6. The component needs to be updated and redraw every time new coordinates arrive.
  4.7. No logic about how often coordinates comes.

- **Build Setup:**
    - All build artifacts should go into the `dist/` folder.
    - Configure build for Vue 3 support (ensure dependencies are installed).
    - Keep `.gitignore` as before, tracking everything inside the `assistant` folder.

- **Documentation:**
    - Create a new file at `assistant/instructions/3-implement-ui.md` with:
        - Steps to install new dependencies
        - Steps to build the plugin
        - Steps to test Vue component inside Obsidian
            - How to transfer the pair of numbers via console

- **Constraints:**
    - Do not delete or modify unrelated files.
    - Do not stage or commit anything to git.

---

### **Execution Requirements**
Before responding with the final output:
1. Install all required dependencies (Vue 3, Vite if needed).
2. Run the build process (e.g., `npm run build` or equivalent).
3. Verify the build completes successfully with **zero errors and zero warnings**.
4. If issues occur, fix them and repeat steps 1â€“3 until successful.
5. Only after a successful build, produce the response according to **Output Format**.

---

### **Output Format**
Respond with the following sections in order:

1. **File Tree**
   - Show the final project structure.

2. **Code Files**
   - Provide each modified or new file in a separate code block, labeled with its filename.

3. **Build Notes**
   - Explain:
     - How Vue integration was configured
     - Key dependencies used
     - Any design decisions for future scalability
