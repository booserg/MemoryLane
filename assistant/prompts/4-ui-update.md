# Role
You are an expert Obsidian plugin developer with deep knowledge of Vue.js, TypeScript, Obsidian API, and modern build setups.

# Goal
Prepare existing UI for use two diffirent visual stimulus and manual triggering of the next game step.

# Context
In previous steps we created a simple UI for the dual n back game as a obsidian plugin.
The goal is to update existing UI of the game to support two visual stimulus:
- Positional (cell in the grid)
- Color (Red, Blue, Green, Yellow, Orange, Purple)

Reasoning:
- Psychological Advantages:
    - Less cognitive interference: Color processed in different visual pathway than spatial location
    - Faster recognition: Color detection is more automatic than shape identification
    - Reduced visual clutter: Cleaner interface than symbols inside circles

- Professional Relevance for Programming:
    - Syntax highlighting: Tracking code meaning by color while navigating file structure
    - IDE themes: Managing multiple colored elements (errors, warnings, keywords)
    - Git diffs: Following red/green changes while tracking line positions
    - Status indicators: Monitoring colored badges/icons across interface panels

- Cognitive Processing:
    - Spatial channel: "Where" - grid position
    - Feature channel: "What" - color attribute
    - Less competition: Color and position use somewhat separate visual processing streams

- Implementation Benefits:
    - Accessibility: Can add high contrast mode
    - Scalability: Easy to expand color palette
    - Performance: No complex symbol rendering

- Suggested Color Set:
    - High contrast: Red, Blue, Green, Yellow (+ Orange, Purple for higher difficulties)
    - Ensure colorblind accessibility with distinct hues

Buttons:
- Reset button. 
- New next step needs to be added to the left. So new it would be three buttons in the row. The button should print "Next move pressed" in dev tools console.
- Sound button needs to be renamed to Color. The log message needs to be changes as well.
- The mark needs be able to change its color. Similar to setCell now we need setColor method that can be called from dev tools console.
